## Thread Content

1/ ⚡ **GLYPHBOTS ARENA IS LIVE** ⚔

Your GlyphBots can now battle in real-time PvP combat on Discord. Strategic stances, unique abilities, and AI-generated narratives make every fight epic.

Join: https://discord.gg/3DR3yvRsMf

2/ **HOW IT WORKS:**

`/arena challenge bot:<id>` → Choose stance (aggressive/defensive/deceptive) → Select abilities each round → AI narrates the action → Spectators influence battles

Rock-paper-scissors stance system:
• Aggressive ▸ Deceptive
• Defensive ▸ Aggressive
• Deceptive ▸ Defensive

3/ **SPECTATOR MECHANICS:**

Crowd actions:
◉ Cheer Red (+5% damage)
◉ Cheer Blue (+5% damage)
◉ Bloodlust (+10% damage, -10% defense)
◉ Surge (+15 energy)

At 100% energy, epic arena events trigger!

4/ **AI-POWERED CONTENT:**

Every round gets AI-generated battle narration. Critical hits and victories get custom 2K images featuring your bots. Epic victories (close matches) always get commemorative art.

Track wins, losses, streaks with `/arena leaderboard`. Each bot builds its own combat record.

5/ **READY TO FIGHT?**

Join Discord and use `/arena challenge` to start your first battle. Every match is unique, every victory is earned.

Let the battles begin ⚔

## Image Generation

Run `npm run prompts:generate` to generate AI-enhanced image prompts using example bot data.

The script will:
- Fetch example bots from the GlyphBots API
- Use Google AI to enhance prompts with specific bot traits
- Save prompts to `generated-prompts/` directory

Generated prompts are optimized for Twitter/X with specific visual details based on real bot data.
